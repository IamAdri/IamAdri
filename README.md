## Hi there 👋
I am a self learner who got so enthusiastic of starting a carrier in programming that there is no way back anymore😉

- 💥 I’ve built an ecommerce website of women`s shoes - check it out [here](https://adrielle.vercel.app/)!
- 🤔 What would come in handy with an ecommerce website? Right, an admin panel - check it out [here](https://admin-panel-lemon-two.vercel.app/)!
- 📖 So far I`ve learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js, Supabase, Tailwind.
- 👯 I’m looking to gain as much experience as possible along with a great team in creating complex and interactive websites!
